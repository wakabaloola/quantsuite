## 🌇 **7:00 AM - Strategy Analysis & Signal Generation**

### **Technical Analysis Workflow**
Alex navigates to `/analytics/signals/` dashboard:

```python
# Behind the scenes: Real-time signal calculation
technical_signal_triggered.send(
    symbol='AAPL',
    indicator='rsi_divergence', 
    signal_type='bullish',
    strength=0.87,
    confidence=0.92
)
```

**Alex sees:**
- **Signal Dashboard** with real-time updates
- **AAPL**: RSI divergence (bullish, 87% strength, 92% confidence)
- **META**: Breaking above 20-day SMA (momentum signal)
- **TSLA**: Bollinger band squeeze ending (volatility breakout expected)

### **Custom Strategy Development**
Alex creates a new mean-reversion strategy:

```python
# Strategy parameters Alex configures via UI
strategy_params = {
    'lookback_period': 20,
    'entry_threshold': -2.0,  # 2 std dev below mean
    'exit_threshold': 0.5,    # 0.5 std dev above mean
    'position_size': 0.02,    # 2% of portfolio per trade
    'max_positions': 5
}
```

**UI Experience:**
1. **Drag-and-drop strategy builder** with technical indicators
2. **Backtest runner** - tests strategy on 2 years historical data
3. **Results**: 23% annual return, 1.34 Sharpe ratio, 8.2% max drawdown
4. **Deploy button** - strategy goes live with paper trading first

# Event-driven execution begins
algorithm_started.send(
    algo_order_id='vwap_meta_001',
    algorithm_type='VWAP',
    parameters=config_params
)
```

### **Real-Time Execution Monitoring**
